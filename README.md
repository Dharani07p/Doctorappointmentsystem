🏥 Doctor Appointment System

The Doctor Appointment System is a web-based full-stack application developed to simplify and digitize the process of booking appointments with doctors. The primary goal of this system is to provide a user-friendly platform where patients can easily schedule appointments, while administrators and doctors can manage and view appointment details in a secure and efficient manner.

1. How It Works

User Registration & Login:

New users (patients or doctors) can register using their basic information like name, email, and password.

Once registered, users can log in using their credentials.

After successful login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards based on their roles.


Role-Based Dashboard Redirection:

If the user is an admin, they are redirected to the Admin Dashboard.

If the user is a doctor, they are redirected to the Doctor Dashboard.

If the user is a patient, they are redirected to the Patient Dashboard.
